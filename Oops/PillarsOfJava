There are basically four main pillars of Java>:-

1.Abstraction:- Simply means hiding the internal details and only showing the
                required details to the user.
                For Example:- Consider a man driving a car, while driving he
                focus on using of steering, gear, accelerator etc.He does not
                require to know the inner mechanism of the car.


2.Encapsulation:- Boxing the things or data into a single unit or section.
                   Encapsulates whole mechanism/code into a single unit.

                   For Example:-  Complete television is single box where all the
                   mechanism are hidden inside the box all are capsuled.



3.Inheritance:- Enhancing the model by adding new features coming from
                the previous features.Reusing the features of the
                existing class-objects.

                It is also known as specialization.

                 For Example  A old style television (idiot box) is transformed with
                 extra features into slim and smart television where it
                 re-used the properties of old television.

4.Polymorphism:- The things are basically generalized through a single group.
                 Polymorphism is a concept in which we can execute a single operation in
                 different ways.
                 polymorphism is same as generalization.

                 tv->Samsung/Sony etc
                 cars->Hyundai/Suzuki etc.
           
           //Famous inerview questions.
                 
Q1} Can I access the static methods by using object-refernce??->Yes we can access, but it is not 
		  considered as a good practise. This should be avoided.
		   a.sum();
Q2} Can we overload the main method in jAVA?
Yes we can. But JVM will recognize only psvm signature with String[] args.
